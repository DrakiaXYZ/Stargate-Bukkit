 Description
=============
This is a port of the Stargate plugin from hMod by Dinnerbone.
Create gates that allow for instant-teleportation between large distances. Gates can be always-open, or triggered, they can be hidden, or accessible to everybody, they can share a network, or they can be split into clusters.
This port will import your existing locations.dat file from the hMod Stargate plugin!
iConomy support added back in, only costs are create, destroy and use.

Instructions
=============
Building a gate:
    OO 
   O  O - These are Obsidian blocks. You need 10.
   O  O - Place a sign on either of these two blocks of Obsidian.
   O  O
    OO

Sign Layout:
 - Line 1: Gate Name (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 2: Destination Name [Optional] (Max 12 characters, used for fixed-gates only)
 - Line 3: Network name [Optional] (Max 12 characters)
 - Line 4: Options [Optional] :
 			'A' for always-on fixed gate
 			'H' for hidden networked gate
 			'P' for a private gate
 			'F' for a free gate
 			'B' is for a backwards facing gate (You will exit the back)
 			'S' is for showing an always-on gate in the network list
 			'N' is for hiding the network name
 			'R' is for random gates. These follow standard permissions of gates, but have a random exit location every time a player enters.

Options:
The options are the single letter, not the word. So to make a private hidden gate, your 4th line would be 'PH'.

Using a gate:
 - Right click the sign to choose a destination.
 - Right click the button to open up a portal.
 - Step through.

Fixed gates:
 - Fixed gates go to only one set destination.
 - Fixed gates can be linked to other fixed gates, or normal gates. A normal gate cannot open a portal to a fixed gate however.
 - To create a fixed gate, specify a destination on the second line of the stargate sign.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to "A" to enable an always-open fixed gate.

Gate networks:
 - Gates are all part of a network, by default this is "central".
 - You can specify (and create) your own network on the third line of the sign when making a new gate.
 - Gates on one network will not see gates on the second network, and vice versa.
 - Gates on different worlds, but in the same network, will see eachother.
 
Hidden Gates:
 - Hidden gates are like normal gates, but only show on the destination list of other gates under certain conditions.
 - A hidden gate is only visible to the creator of the gate, or somebody with the stargate.hidden permission.
 - Set the 4th line of the stargate sign to 'H' to make it a hidden gate.
 
iConomy Support:
 The latest version of Stargate has support for iConomy. Gate creation, destruction and use can all have different costs associated with them. You can also define per-gate layout costs. The default cost is assigned in the config.yml file, while the per-gate costs re defined in the .gate files. To define a certain cost to a gate just add these lines to your .gate file:
usecost=5
destroycost=5
createcost=5
toowner=true

==============
Custom Gate Layout
==============
You can create as many gate formats as you want, the gate layouts are stored in plugins/Stargate/gates/
The .gate file must be laid out a specific way, the first lines will be config information, and after a blank line you will lay out the gate format. Here is the default nether.gate file:

portal-open=90
portal-closed=0
X=49
-=49

 XX 
X..X
-..-
X*.X
 XX 

portal-open/closed are used to define the material in the gate when it is open or closed. 
"X" and "-" are used to define block "types" for the layout (Any single-character can be used, such as "#").
In the gate format, you can see we use "X" to show where obsidian must be, "-" where the controls (Button/sign) are.
You will also notice a "*" in the gate layout, this is the "exit point" of the gate, the block at which the player will teleport in front of.
As of version 0.5.5 you can supply block data in the format
X=35:15
Which would only allow black wool. If no data is supplied any version of a block will work (Any color of wool for example)
 
==============
Configuration
==============
default-gate-network - The default gate network
portal-folder - The folder your portal databases are saved in
gate-folder - The folder containing your .gate files
destroyexplosion - Whether to destroy a stargate with explosions, or stop an explosion if it contains a gates controls.
useiconomy - Whether or not to use iConomy
createcost - The cost to create a stargate
destroycost - The cost to destroy a stargate (Can be negative for a "refund"
usecost - The cost to use a stargate
chargefreedestination - Enable to allow free travel from any gate to a free gate
freegatesgreen - Enable to make gates that won't cost the player money show up as green
toowner - Whether the money from gate-use goes to the owner or nobody
maxgates - If non-zero, will define the maximum amount of gates allowed on any network.
lang - The language to use (Included languages: en, de)
destMemory - Whether to set the first destination as the last used destination for all gates
ignoreEntrance - Set this option to true to not check the entrance of a gate on startup. This is a workaround for snowmen breaking gates.
handleVehicles - Whether or not to handle vehicles going through gates. Set to false to disallow vehicles (Manned or not) going through gates.
sortLists - If true, network lists will be sorted alphabetically.
protectEntrance - If true, will protect from users breaking gate entrance blocks (This is more resource intensive than the usual check, and should only be enabled for servers that use solid open/close blocks)
signColor: This allows you to specify the color of the gate signs. Valid colors:

debug - Whether to show massive debug output
permdebug - Whether to show massive permission debug output

=======================
 Message Customization
=======================
As of 0.6.5 it is possible to customize all of the messages Stargate displays, including the [Stargate] prefix. You can find the strings in plugins/Stargate/lang/en.txt. 
If a string is removed, or left blank, it will not be shown when the user does the action associated with it.
There are three special cases when it comes to messages, these are:
ecoDeduct=Spent %cost%
ecoRefund=Refunded %cost%
ecoObtain=Obtained %cost% from Stargate %portal%

As you can see, these three strings have %cost% and %portal% variables in them. These variables are fairly self-explanatory.

The full list of strings is as follows:
prefix=[Stargate] 
teleportMsg=Teleported
destroyMsg=Gate Destroyed
invalidMsg=Invalid Destination
blockMsg=Destination Blocked
denyMsg=Access Denied
destEmpty=Destination List Empty

ecoDeduct=Deducted %cost%
ecoRefund=Redunded %cost%
ecoObtain=Obtained %cost% from Stargate %portal%
ecoInFunds=Insufficient Funds

createMsg=Gate Created
createNetDeny=You do not have access to that network
createPersonal=Creating gate on personal network
createNameLength=Name too short or too long.
createExists=A gate by that name already exists
createFull=This network is full
createWorldDeny=You do not have access to that world
createConflict=Gate conflicts with existing gate

 Known Bugs
=============
Unable to reproduce: Stargates teleport a user into the ground/under the ground
Bukkit Issue: Stargate will randomly NPE when drawing a sign. Long-standing Bukkit
              issue, that they just made worse by disallowing me to override the
              sign class. This won't actually affect Stargate use.
